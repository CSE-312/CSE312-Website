        <h3 class="card-title">Weekly Meetings</h3>

        <p>
            All scheduled recitation sections are cancelled and replaced with team meetings which will start on week 5
            of the semester. Your team will schedule a time and location for these meetings and all team members will
            submit the team meeting form after each meeting.
        </p>

        <p>
            Meeting submissions and peer evaluations will be used as evidence when making individual grade adjustment
            decisions at the end of the semester.
        </p>

        <p>
            You may fill out the meeting form as often as you'd like, not just when you have a team meeting. Many
            students prefer to fill out the form again to rate their team after the project deadline even if
            they don't have a team meeting after the deadline.
        </p>

        <h3 class="card-title">Submissions</h3>

        <p>
            The entire project is due after the last day of classes. There is no submission at the deadline.
            After the due date, we will clone your repository and grade based on the code you've pushed.

        <h3 class="card-title">Open-Source Reports</h3>
        <p>
            As opposed to the homework assignments, you are allowed to use external libraries, frameworks, and services
            for your project.
            For example, instead of building your site starting with a TCP socket server you can use technology
            such as Express, Flask, Django, React, Angular, Handlebars, Socket.io,
            etc. However, you are required to write several reports explaining how these libraries function. See the
            project requirements document for specific requirements on the reports that need to be written.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each report must answer:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Explain what this technology does in your project. What problems does it solve for you?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                How does this technology accomplish what it does?
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Explain in detail how this technology works. You must
                        include links to any relevant code within the libraries themselves (Not your code where you
                        use the library). You must
                        include links to the exact code that solves your problem for you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ex. If
                        you use express for your web framework you must explain how express handles an HTTP request
                        and link to the exact code on
                        GitHub that parses HTTP headers.
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                What license(s) or terms of service apply to this technology?
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When using technology you did not write you will be subject to certain agreements. List any licences
                    attached to the project (Ex. MIT, Apache) and what that license means for your project. If using
                    a service, review the terms of service and explain all the implications of these terms for your
                    project.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Why?:</b> Developing a website using existing frameworks/libraries/services does not require
            years of CSE education and is not appropriate for a project in a 300-level technical course.
            The use of frameworks/libraries/services are required for this project, and strongly encouraged outside of
            this course, but you must prove that you
            understand what is being done for you by other developers and how they do it. <b>In this course, you cannot
            use technology that you do not understand.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            If any reports
            are missing, inadequate, or don't go into enough depth,
            the team is in violation and the project may become invalid. Consequences will be decided by the course staff on
            a case-by-case basis which can range up to a 0 for the entire project.

        <h3 class="card-title">Grading</h3>

        <p>
            <b>Features: </b>Each project has 3 features outlined in the project requirements document. Each feature
            will be graded in the same manner as the homework objectives and are worth 1 application objective each.
        </p>

        <p><b>Reports: </b>The project requirements document describes 3 open-source reports that are required. Each
            report is worth 1 application objective. To provide a round of feedback on these reports, there is a
            Team Project Reports Checkpoint listed on the course schedule. After this checkpoint, a TA will review the
            reports in your repository and provide feedback to you that will be posted on AutoLab. If your reports are
            complete at this point, you can earn the application objectives early. If they are not complete, you will
            receive feedback on what you have and you can correct/complete them by the project deadline on the last
            day of class to earn credit.
        </p>


        <p>
            <b>Security</b>: If there are any security issues with your project that have been covered in lecture,
            your grade for each feature that exposes the vulnerability will be changed to 0. Your
            entire project grade may be changed to 0 at the discretion of the course staff and depending on the
            severity of the security vulnerability.
