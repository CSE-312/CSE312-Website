            <li>User Accounts</li>
            <li>Live sharing of multimedia content between users</li>
            <li>Users can "vote" and comment on user-submitted content</li>

        <p>
            All scheduled recitation sections are cancelled and replaced with team meetings which will start on week 5
            of the semester. Your team will schedule a time for these meetings and all team members will submit the
            team meeting form after each meeting.
        </p>

        <p>
            Meeting submissions and peer evaluations will be used to adjust individual grades at the discretion of the
            course staff. The average individual score for a team will equal the team score for each phase (ie. An
            entire team will not be penalized based on meetings and evaluations).

        <p>
            Your team must keep all code for your project in a GitHub repository. The state of the master branch of
            this repository at the time of the deadline will be you official submission for that phase. In addition,
            your team will make a video demo of you software and upload it to YouTube.

        <h3 class="card-title">Open-Source Reports</h3>
        <p>
            As opposed to the homework assignments, you are allowed to use libraries, frameworks, and services for your
            project.
            For example, instead of building your site starting with a TCP socket server you can use open-source code
            such as Express, Flask, Django, React, Angular, Handlebars, Apache, Nginx, Socket.io, Heroku, AWS, Firebase,
            etc. Any time you use software that was not written by your team you must provide a report for that
            software.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Report:</b> For each library or framework used in your project your team must submit a technical
            report explaining what it accomplishes, how it works, and the licenses
            involved. In addition to the report, every team member who developed on that part of the project using a
            specific technology must be prepared to answer questions about it at all times (Especially during your
            presentation).
        </p>

        <p>
            Each report must answer:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Explain what this technology does in your project. What problems does it solve for you?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                How does this technology accomplish what it does?
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For each problem this technology solves for you, explain in detail how it solves it starting
                        with a TCP socket connection. You must
                        include links to any relevant documentation or code. If the technology is open-source, you must
                        include links to the exact code that solves your problem for you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ex. If
                        you use express for your web framework you must explain how express handles an HTTP request
                        starting with a TCP connection to
                        include how it routes requests, how headers are parsed, etc. and link to the exact code on
                        GitHub that parses HTTP headers. Any other express features used must also be explained and the
                        code linked.
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                What license(s) or terms of service apply to this technology?
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When using technology you did not write you will be subject to certain agreements. List any licences
                    attached to the project (Ex. MIT, Apache) and what that licenses means for your project. If using
                    a service, review the terms of service and explain all the implications of these terms for your
                    project.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Why?:</b> Developing a website using existing frameworks/libraries/services does not require
            years of CSE education and is not appropriate for a project in a 300-level technical course.
            The use of frameworks/libraries/services are allowed for this project, and strongly encouraged outside of
            this course, but you must prove that you
            understand what is being done for you by other developers, how they do it, and why you made the choice to
            use it. In this course, you cannot use technology that you do not understand.
        </p>

        <p>
            A report must be included in your repository for each library/framework used in your project. If any reports
            are missing, inadequate, or a team member who developed with a technology fails to answer questions about it
            the consequence will be decided by the course staff on a case-by-case basis. A change in grade may result
            up to and including a 0 for all 4 parts of the project.
