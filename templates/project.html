        <p>
            You'll work in teams of 4-5 to create a web app of your own design which must include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>User Accounts with Secure Authentication</li>
            <li>Users to see all users who are currently logged in</li>
            <li>Users can send direct messages (DM) to other users with notifications when a DM is received</li>
            <li>Users can share some form of multimedia content which is stored and hosted on your server</li>
            <li>Live interactions between users via WebSockets (Cannot be text)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You are free to design your app any way you'd like as long as these 5 features are included.
        </p>

        <p>
            A sample app that satisfies these 5 requirements that can be used, and possibly the simplest app that
            meets all 5, could include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li>User Accounts with Secure Authentication</li>
            <li>Users to see all users who are currently logged in</li>
            <li>Users can send direct messages (DM) to other users with notifications when a DM is received</li>
            <li>Users can share some form of multimedia content which is stored and hosted on your server</li>
            <li>Live interactions between users via WebSockets (Cannot be text)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You will also give a presentation showing off your project at the end of the semester.

        <h3 class="card-title">Weekly Meetings</h3>

        <p>
            All scheduled recitation sections are cancelled and replaced with team meetings which will start on week 5
            of the semester. Your team will schedule a time and location for these meetings and all team members will
            submit the team meeting form after each meeting.
        </p>

            Meeting Form</a>
<br/>
<br/>
        <p>
            Meeting submissions and peer evaluations will be used to adjust individual grades at the discretion of the
            course staff. The average individual score for a team will equal the team score for each phase (ie. An
            entire team will not be penalized based on meetings and evaluations). Individual grade adjustments will
            not result in a score > 100%.

        <h3 class="card-title">Open-Source Reports</h3>
        <p>
            As opposed to the homework assignments, you are allowed to use external libraries, frameworks, and services
            for your project.
            For example, instead of building your site starting with a TCP socket server you can use technology
            such as Express, Flask, Django, React, Angular, Handlebars, Apache, Nginx, Socket.io,
            etc. However, any time you use technology that was not developed by your team you must provide a report for
            that technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Report:</b> For each technology used in your project that would not be allowed for a homework assignment,
            your team must submit a technical
            report explaining what it accomplishes, how it works, and the licenses
            involved. In addition to the report, every team member who helped develop the part of the project using a
            specific technology must be prepared to answer questions about it at all times.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each report must answer:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Explain what this technology does in your project. What problems does it solve for you?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                How does this technology accomplish what it does?
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For each problem this technology solves for you, explain in detail how it solves it starting
                        with a TCP socket connection. You must
                        include links to any relevant documentation or code. If the technology is open-source, you must
                        include links to the exact code that solves your problem for you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ex. If
                        you use express for your web framework you must explain how express handles an HTTP request
                        starting with a TCP connection to
                        include how it routes requests, how headers are parsed, etc. and link to the exact code on
                        GitHub that parses HTTP headers and routes paths. Any other express features used must also be
                        explained and the code linked. You do not have to explain features of the library that are not
                        used in your project.
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                What license(s) or terms of service apply to this technology?
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When using technology you did not write you will be subject to certain agreements. List any licences
                    attached to the project (Ex. MIT, Apache) and what that license means for your project. If using
                    a service, review the terms of service and explain all the implications of these terms for your
                    project.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Why?:</b> Developing a website using existing frameworks/libraries/services does not require
            years of CSE education and is not appropriate for a project in a 300-level technical course.
            The use of frameworks/libraries/services are allowed for this project, and strongly encouraged outside of
            this course, but you must prove that you
            understand what is being done for you by other developers and how they do it. <b>In this course, you cannot
            use technology that you do not understand.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            A report must be included in your repository for each library/framework used in your project. If any reports
            are missing, inadequate, or a team member who developed with a technology fails to answer questions about it
            the team is in violation and the project may become invalid. Consequences will be decided by the course staff on
            a case-by-case basis which can range up to a 0 for the entire project.
        </p>

        <h3 class="card-title">Grading</h3>

        <p>
            Project grading is based on your team's completion of each of the features. Features will be equally
            weighted.
        </p>

        <p>Note: If you complete a feature without complete reports for all libraries used, you will earn a 0 for that
            feature.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Security</b>: If there are any security issues with your project that have been covered in lecture,
            your grade for each feature that exposes the vulnerability will be changed to 0. Your
            entire project grade may be changed to 0 at the discretion of the course staff and depending on the
            severity of the security vulnerability.
        </p>
