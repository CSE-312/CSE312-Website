                    <li>Clone the starter code from the repository into a new IntelliJ project</li>
                    <li>Make sure the src folder is marked as the source root (Right click the src
                        folder, choose “mark directory as” and choose sources root)

                    Once you have the project opened in IntelliJ, you'll see a src folder containing 2
                    Java packages named ratings and tests. Your code for this Task will go in the
                    ratings.ProblemSet class, while your testing will go in tests.TestProblemSet. For
                    now, the rest of the classes can be ignored, though they will be used in future Tasks.

                    To submit your project, create a zip file containing your entire project and
                    submit it to AutoLab. (Click file -> export -> Project to Zip File, though there may be
                    slight differences to this across OSes and versions)

                    This is primarily a testing task and your feedback in AutoLab will begin by checking your tests.
                    You will write tests for 3 different methods. All of your testing will be in the
                    tests.TestProblemSet class. You are strongly encouraged to write many individual tests in this one
                    class.

                                Add tests to the tests.TestProblemSet class that will test a static method named average
                                in the ratings.ProblemSet class
                            </li>
                            <li> The average method will take an ArrayList of Doubles as
                                a parameter and returns the average of the values in the ArrayList as a double
                            </li>

                                Add tests to the tests.TestProblemSet class that will test a static method named

                                The sumOfDigits method will take an int as
                                a parameter and returns the sum of the digits of the input as an int
                            </li>
                            <li>

                            <li>
                                Add tests to the tests.TestProblemSet class that will test a static method named
                                bestKey in the ratings.ProblemSet class
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The bestKey method will take a HashMap of Strings to Integers as a parameter and
                                returns a key mapping to the largest Integer

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the HashMap is empty, the method should return the empty String
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The method may break ties arbitrarily. When you write a test case where there are
                                multiple correct solutions, you must accept any of these as correct return values in
                                your test
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Examples:

                                    <li>bestKey({"CSE": 100, "MTH": 90, "MGT": 10}) returns "CSE"</li>
                                    <li>bestKey({"cat": 5, "dog": 5, "fox": 4}) can return either "cat" or "dog"</li>
                                    <li>bestKey({}) returns ""</li>
                                </ul>

                    The feedback in AutoLab will be given in 3 phases. If you don't complete a phase, then feedback for
                    the following phase(s) will not be given.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Your tests will be run against a solution that is known to be correct. If your tests do
                                not pass this correct solution, there is an error somewhere in your tests that must be
                                fixed
                                before you can move on with the assignment. This can be caused by misunderstanding the
                                task
                                requirements from this document, or rejecting alternate solutions (eg. Only accepting
                                one
                                possible answer when there is a tie for bestKey)

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The next phase is to run your tests against incorrect solutions. This will assess the
                                thoroughness of your tests. Your tests must be able to fail all of the incorrect
                                solutions to pass this phase. If your tests pass an incorrect solution, it is an
                                indicator that you need to add more testing
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Passing this phase does not necessarily mean that your testing is completely thorough.
                                Satisfying AutoLab is the bare minimum testing requirement. The incorrect solutions will
                                not cover every possible mistake, and it is sometimes possible to pass this phase
                                with very weak testing. If you are struggling to earn credit for code that you believe
                                is correct, you should write more than the required tests
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Once AutoLab is happy with your tests, it will run my tests against your code to check
                                it for correctness. If your testing is thorough, and your code passes your tests, then
                                you should pass this phase. If you pass your tests, but fail one of mine, it is an
                                indicator that you should write more tests to help expose your bug
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                <p>
                    Once you complete all 3 phases, you will have completed this Task and AutoLab will confirm this
                    with a score of 1 for complete.
