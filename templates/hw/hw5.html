        <hr>
        <p>Each objective will be scored on a 0-3 scale as follows:</p>

        <table class="table table-bordered table-skinny">
            <tr>
                <td>3 (Complete)</td>
                <td>Clearly correct</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2 (Complete)</td>
                <td>Mostly correct, but with some minor issues
                </td>
            <tr>
                <td>1 (Incomplete)</td>
                <td>Not all features outlined in this document are functional, but an honest attempt was made to
                    complete the objective
                </td>
            <tr>
                <td>0.3 (Incomplete)</td>
                <td>The objective would earn a 3, but a security risk was found while testing</td>
            <tr>
                <td>0.2 (Incomplete)</td>
                <td>The objective would earn a 2, but a security risk was found while testing</td>
            <tr>
                <td>0.1 (Incomplete)</td>
                <td>The objective would earn a 1, but a security risk was found while testing</td>

        <br>
        <p>Note that for your final grade there is no difference between a 2 and 3, or a 0 and a 1. The numeric score
            is meant to give you more feedback on your work.</p>

        <h3>Security Essay</h3>
        <br>
        <p>For each objective for which you earned a 0.3 or 0.2, you will still have an opportunity to earn credit for
            the
            objective by submitting an essay about the security issue you exposed. These essays must:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Be at least 1000 words in length</li>
            <li>Explain the security issue from your submission with specific details about your code</li>
            <li>Describe how you fixed the issue in your submission with specific details about the code you changed
            </li>
            <li>Explain why this security issue is a concern and the damage that could be done if you exposed this issue
                in
                production code with live users
            </li>
        </ul>


        <p>Any submission that does not meet all these criteria will be rejected and your objective will remain
            incomplete.</p>

        <p>Due Date: Security essays are due 1-week after grades are released.</p>

        <p>Any essay may be subject to an interview with the course staff to verify that you understand the importance
            of
            the security issue that you exposed. If an interview is required, you will be contacted by the course staff
            for
            scheduling. Decisions of whether or not an interview is required will be made at the discretion of the
            course
            staff.</p>

        <p>When you don't have to write an essay:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you never submit a security violation, you never have to write an essay for this course. Be safe. Be
                secure
            </li>
            <li>If you earn a 0.1, there's no need to write an essay since you would not complete the objective anyway
            </li>
        </ul>
