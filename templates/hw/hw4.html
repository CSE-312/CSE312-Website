        <p>
            If you haven't already on HW3, please go to this line in your server.py:
            "socketserver.TCPServer.allow_reuse_address = True" and "server = socketserver.TCPServer((host, port),
            MyTCPHandler)".
            Change both of these lines from <b>TCPServer</b> to <b>ThreadingTCPServer</b>.
            This will make sure that your server can handle multiple requests at once, without blocking other requests.

        <h4>Helper Method: compute_accept</h4>

        <p>
            In a file named websockets in the util package, write a function named compute_accept that takes a WebSocket
            key as a parameter (As a string) and returns the correct accept (As a string) according to the WebSocket
            handshake.
        </p>
        <p>
            The output must be character for character exactly what is expected. Make sure you don't have any extra
            characters in your output (Not even white space).
        </p>
        <p>
            You may use libraries to compute the SHA1 hash and Base64 encoding.
        </p>


        <br>
        <h4>Helper Method: parse_ws_frame</h4>

        Add a function named parse_ws_frame to the util.websockets file.
        <p>
            Add a function named parse_ws_frame to the util.websockets file that takes bytes as a parameter that
            represents the bytes of a WebSocket frame and parses all the values of the frame. The function returns an
            object containing the following fields (You have some freedom in how you design the class for this object as
            long as it has the required fields).
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                fin_bit
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An int with the value of the fin bit (Either 1 or 0)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                opcode
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An int with the value of the opcode (eg. if the op code is bx1000, this field stores 8 as an
                        int)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                payload_length
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The payload length as an int. Your function must handle all 3 payload length modes
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                payload
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The unmasked bytes of the payload
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>


        <br>
        <h4>Helper Method: generate_ws_frame</h4>

        Add a function named generate_ws_frame to the util.websockets file.

        <p>
            Add a function named generate_ws_frame to the util.websockets file that takes bytes as a parameter and
            returns a properly formatted WebSocket frame (As bytes) with the input bytes as its payload. Use a fin bit
            of 1, an op code of bx0001 for text, and no mask. You need to handle all 3 payload length modes.
        </p>


        <br>
        <hr>
        <h4>WebSocket Connections</h4>

        <p>
            With your 3 helper methods ready, you will now add WebSocket features to your app. First, add the following
            HTML paths to your server:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>"/test-websocket" - Render test-websocket.html</li>
            <li>"/drawing-board" - Render drawing-board.html</li>
            <li>"/direct-messaging" - Render direct-messaging.html</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The front end will initiate a WebSocket connection using the "/websocket" path. When you receive a request
            on this path, you should go through the WS handshake to upgrade the connection.
        </p>

        <p>
            When the connection is established, all WS message will be in the form of JSON objects and will all contain
            a field named "messageType". This messageType will determine how to handle the message.
        </p>

        <br>
        <hr>
        <h4>WebSocket Echo</h4>

        <p>
            Implement an echo feature that will be used on the Test WebSocket page. For this feature, whenever you
            receive a WS message of type "echo_client", read the message from the "text" field which is what the user
            typed and sent. In response, send a WS message back to only the sender of type "echo_server" with a field
            named "text" containing the exact message that was sent to your server.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if your server receives a WS frame containing the payload:
        </p>
        <p>
            {"messageType":"echo_client","text":"WebSockets are for winners"}
        </p>
        <p>
            You will send a WS frame back to the sender containing the payload:
        </p>
        <p>
            {"messageType":"echo_server","text":"WebSockets are for winners"}
        </p>

        <p>
            These message can, and will during testing, be large enough to test all 3 payload length modes. This also
            implies that you must implement buffering for the WebSocket frames you receive. Continuation frames are not
            required for this objective.
        </p>

        <br>
        <hr>
        <h4>Drawing Board</h4>

        <p>
            Implement the shared drawing board from the Drawing Board page. When a user draws, the client will send WS
            messages of type "drawing" to your server. When you receive a message of this type, you will:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Broadcast the message to every user with an active WS connection. The message contents should be
                unchanged, including the same messageType of "drawing". The front end will know how to display these
                messages
            </li>
            <li>
                Store all the information of the message in your database (This includes the fields "startX", "startY",
                "endX", "endY", and "color")
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            When a user first creates a WS connection, send them the drawings that have already been made (It is ok if
            you always send this even when the user is not on the Drawing Board page). This should be sent in a WS
            message of type "init_strokes" containing a field "strokes" that is an array of all the drawing messages
            received by your server. This feature will allow users to see all
            the drawings that have been made before they loaded the page since only the new drawings are broadcast. You
            should now be able to refresh the page and still see all the drawings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example Message: {"messageType": "init_strokes", "strokes": [{"startX": 283.1, "startY": 232.7, "endX":
            287.5, "endY": 152.2, "color": "#000000"}, ... ]}
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that you will need a way to store all WS connections in a way that can be accessed from all connections
            to enable broadcasting.
        </p>

        <br>
        <hr>
        <h4>User List and Heartbeat</h4>

        <p>
            Send a message of type "user_list" containing a field named "users" with an array containing all the
            authenticated users who have an active WS connection. Each user is represented as an object with a field
            "username"
        </p>
        <p>
            Example Message: {"messageType": "user_list", "users": [{"username": "admin"}, {"username": "cse312"}]}
        </p>

        <p>
            Broadcast this message to all WS users whenever this list changes. This includes whenever you finish a WS
            handshake (adding a user), and whenever you see a disconnect opcode (removing a user).
        </p>

            Application Objective 1 - Continuation Frames and Back-to-Back Messages
        </h3>
        <hr/>


        <p>
            Expand your WebSocket code to support the processing of multiple frames under the following two conditions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Continuation Frames
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Check the FIN bit and handle messages that are sent over multiple frames. We will test with
                        payloads > 131000 using chrome which sends messages over this size in multiple frames
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                Back-to-Back Frames
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Your server must also handle multiple messages sent back-to-back. If another frame is sent while
                        you are buffering, your last read from the TCP socket may contain the beginning of the next
                        frame. Ensure that you are properly parsing these frames even when one read from the socket
                        contains parts of multiple frames
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
            Application Objective 2 - Direct Messaging (DMs)
        </h3>
        <hr>

        <p>
            Implement DMs on the Direct Messaging page. To accomplish this, add the following functionality to your
            server:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                When a client sends a WS message of type "select_user", which means they chose this user from the DM
                dropdown, send them all the DM history between them and the chosen user
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You'll receive a message in this format - {"messageType":"select_user","targetUser":"koby"}
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Send this user a WS message of type "message_history" containing all the DMs sent between these
                        2 users sorted by age (Oldest first)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Message history format - {"messageType": "message_history", "messages": [{"messageType":
                        "direct_message", "fromUser": "admin", "text": "hi"}, {"messageType": "direct_message",
                        "fromUser": "koby", "text": "hey"}]}
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Users send message DMs as WS messages of type "direct_message"
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        DM format (from client) - {"messageType":"direct_message", "targetUser":"koby", "text":"hi"}
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When you receive a DM, store it in your database and send the message to both clients in the
                        conversation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        DM format (from server) - {"messageType": "direct_message", "fromUser": "admin", "text": "hey"}
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Security: Do not send DMs to anyone other than the 2 users who are part of the conversation.

        <p>For each objective for which you earned a 0.3 or 0.2, you will still have an opportunity to earn credit for
            the
            objective by submitting an essay about the security issue you exposed. These essays must:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Be at least 1000 words in length</li>
            <li>Explain the security issue from your submission with specific details about your code</li>
            <li>Describe how you fixed the issue in your submission with specific details about the code you changed
            </li>
            <li>Explain why this security issue is a concern and the damage that could be done if you exposed this issue
                in
                production code with live users
            </li>
        </ul>


        <p>Any submission that does not meet all these criteria will be rejected and your objective will remain
            incomplete.</p>

        <p>Due Date: Security essays are due 1-week after grades are released.</p>

        <p>Any essay may be subject to an interview with the course staff to verify that you understand the importance
            of
            the security issue that you exposed. If an interview is required, you will be contacted by the course staff
            for
            scheduling. Decisions of whether or not an interview is required will be made at the discretion of the
            course
            staff.</p>

        <p>When you don't have to write an essay:</p>
