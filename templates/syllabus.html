        <h3 class="card-title">Learning Objectives</h3>

        <p class="card-text">
            Being successful in CSE312 requires you to complete a total of 8 learning objectives, all of which are
            programming objectives. The first 2 objectives (out of 5) on each homework assignment are learning
            objectives. You must complete all of these objectives on time in order to pass the class.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each homework will have 2 deadlines listed on the course schedule. The first will be the learning objective
            expected deadline. This is the time when you are expected to have completed the learning objectives for
            the assignment. You should always aim to complete the learning objectives by this deadline. The second
            deadline is the actual deadline for all 5 objectives of the assignment. Since you must complete all 8
            learning objectives by this second deadline, there are some provision provided for you to allow some
            leniency.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Late Days: </b> You will be given 4 late days to use throughout the semester on the 4 programming
            assignments. You may use these days however you'd like including using all 4 on the same assignment. Though,
            it is highly recommended to not use these on the first assignment since you will want to save them for
            the more difficult assignments. If you make a submission that even 1 second late, you will be charged a
            late day and your deadline will be extended by 24 hours. Late day usage applies to <b>all</b> objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Recovery Opportunities: </b>Since you must complete all 8 learning objectives to complete the course,
            you will be given 4 recovery opportunities that can be used on any learning objectives. Using a recovery
            opportunity on a learning objective will give you a 1-week extension on that objective. Please note that
            this is on a per-objective basis. If you missed both learning objectives on a single assignment then you'll
            need to use 2 recovery opportunities on a single assignment.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you use all your late days and recovery opportunities and still have not completed a learning objective,
            you will fail the class.

        <h4>Application Objectives</h4>

        <p>
            You can improve your letter grade by showing that you can <b>apply</b> the learning objectives to solve
            <b>real-world problems</b>. You will have the following opportunities to complete application objectives.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Programming x12
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each or the 4 homework assignments contain 3 application objectives. Complete these to earn
                    application objectives.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Deadlines cannot be extended on these tasks except by using late days. You cannot use
                    recovery opportunities on these tasks.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Expected Deadlines x2
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each of the 8 learning objectives have 2 deadlines.
                    The first is the expected deadline which is the time at which the course
                    staff expects a student who is putting in their 12 hours/week to complete the task. If this course
                    used standard percentage-based grading, this would be the only deadline. Since the consequences are
                    so harsh
                    for missing a single task (To ensure that you learn <b>all</b> of the material) the actual deadlines
                    have been extended by 1 week to give you ample time to study the material. However, to encourage you
                    to still meet the expected deadlines, you can earn application objectives by completing learning
                    objectives before these expected deadlines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you complete at least 3 of the 8 learning objectives before their expected deadlines, you will
                    earn 1 application objective.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you complete at least 6 of the 8 learning objectives before their expected deadlines, you will
                    earn 2 application objective.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Lecture Questions x3
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Most lectures will include multiple choice questions to be answered during live lectures. These
                    will be simple
                    questions designed to encourage you to attend lecture and stay up to date on the material. Since
                    lectures will be recorded, there is a temptation to watch lecture days, or even weeks, after they
                    occur. These questions are to serve as an incentive for you to attend lecture and avoid falling
                    behind in the course.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you answer >=50% of the total available lecture question correctly, you will earn 1 application
                    objective.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you answer >=70% of the total available lecture question correctly, you will earn 2 application
                    objectives.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you answer >=90% of the total available lecture question correctly, you will earn 3 application
                    objectives.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Group Project - Submission x6
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You will work in a group to complete a project throughout this semester. More details about the
                    project itself can be found in the project section. The project will contain opportunities to earn 6
                    application objectives: 3 objectives related to the functionality of your code and 3 related to your
                    completion of 3 open-source reports.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These 6 application objectives are subject to individual grade adjustments. If a team member completes
                    significantly more/less than their teammates, their number of application objectives awarded may be
                    adjusted at the discretion of the course staff. It is not uncommon for a slacker to be awarded a 0
                    if they did not meaningfully contribute to the project.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>Group Project - Presentation/Demo x3
            <ul>
                <li>
                    At the end of the semester, your team will present your project to the class with an opportunity
                    to earn 3 more application objectives. You will demo the live/deployed version of your app while
                    the audience uses your app and interacts with your software. Again, more details are provided in
                    the project section.

        <h3 class="card-title">Homework</h3>

        <p>
            Each assignment will be a programming/development assignment with a submission of your software on AutoLab,
            though there will be <b>little/no automated grading in this course</b>. You will submit
            all of the code and files that comprise your software on AutoLab in a single zip file.

        <p>The following apply to all homework assignments except where exceptions are explicitly stated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may choose any programming language you prefer</li>
            <li>No external libraries or frameworks are allowed if the library implements functionality that we

            <li>Any libraries/packages/classes/functions/etc included with your language of choice that complete part
                of an assignment - related to the course content - for you are not allowed. This includes any and all
                HTTP libraries and frameworks</li>
            <li>Code included with your language of choice that handles TCP socket servers and concurrency are allowed.
                Most assignments will start with a TCP socket server upon which you'll develop a web server. Industry
                standard external libraries for TCP and concurrency are allowed if they are common in the community

        <p>

            All submitted work must be of your own creation and you must not share your submission with anyone else. If
            any submission is very similar to what has been submitted by another student,
            or can be found online, it is in violation of this courses academic integrity policy and all students will
            be penalized whether they were copying or sharing their submission with other students so they can copy. If two
            submissions are similar beyond what is likely if the students worked independently, then <b>both students
            are in violation</b> of the academic integrity policy.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
