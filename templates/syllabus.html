        <h4>Application Objectives</h4>

        <p>
            You can earn application objectives to improve your grade in this course. Most of these objectives are
            designed to encourage you to stay up-to-date on the content of the course.
            You will have the following opportunities to complete application objectives.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Homework Learning Objectives x18
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each of the first 3 homework assignments contain 3 learning objectives each. These learning
                    objectives must be completed by the final deadline on the last day of classes in order to pass
                    the class. However, there are 3 deadlines for each homework and completing an objective by an
                    earlier deadline will earn you application objectives
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Expected Deadline:</b> As the name implies, this is when you are expected to complete all the
                    objectives of an assignment. For each objective you complete by this deadline, you will earn 2
                    application objectives
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Late Deadline:</b> This deadline is 2 weeks after the expected deadline. For each objective you
                    complete by this deadline, you will earn 1 application objective
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Final Deadline:</b> You must complete all 9 learning objectives before this deadline or you will
                    fail the class. This deadline is the night of the last day of classes for all 9 objectives
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Homework Application Objectives x8
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each of the 4 homework assignments will contain 1 application objectives. You will earn application
                    objectives for these objectives the same way you do for learning objectives
                    (ie. complete by expected deadline for 2 AOs and before the late deadline for 1 AO) except you do
                    not have to complete these objectives to pass the class. This implies that if you do not complete
                    these objectives before the late deadline, you can no longer earn any credit for them
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Lecture Questions x4
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Most lectures will include multiple choice questions to be answered during live lectures. These
                    will be simple
                    questions designed to encourage you to attend lecture and stay up to date on the material. Since
                    lectures will be recorded, there is a temptation to watch lecture days, or even weeks, after they
                    occur. These questions are to serve as an incentive for you to attend lecture and avoid falling
                    behind in the course.

                <li>

                <li>

                <li>

        <p>

            All submitted work must be of your own creation and you must not share your submission with anyone else. If
            any submission is very similar to what has been submitted by another student,
            or can be found online, it is in violation of this courses academic integrity policy and all students will
            be penalized whether they were copying or sharing their submission with other students so they can copy. If two
            submissions are similar beyond what is likely if the students worked independently, then <b>both students
            are in violation</b> of the academic integrity policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            All violations will result in:

        <p>
            It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
            any question whether something you are doing is a violation or not, ask for
            clarification <b>before receiving an F in the course</b>. I will not entertain excuses after you
            have been caught.

            Examples of acceptable behavior:
