        <h3 class="card-title">Recitations</h3>
        <p class="card-text">
            Starting on week 2, you will have recitation sections. These recitations will provide a chance for you to
            get extra help from the TAs in smaller groups. In general, recitation
            will offer examples, demos, and review of the previous week of content. Though you should come to these
            recitations with questions so
            the TA can present specifically about the content that is proving difficult for you.
        </p>

        <p>
            The TAs may take attendance during recitation. This attendance does not directly affect your grade.
            However, if you are struggling in the course and are taking advantage of recitations, and therefore showing
            an effort to learn the material, there may be some leniency offered if you are in danger of failing. Do
            not expect any leniency, or addition chances to pass, if you regularly skip recitation.

        <h3 class="card-title">Learning Objectives</h3>

        <p class="card-text">
            Being successful in CSE312 requires you to complete a total of 12 learning objectives, all of which are
            programming objectives. Each of the first 4 homework assignments contain 3 learning objectives each.
            You must complete all of these objectives in order to pass the class.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are 2 deadlines for each homework assignment which are an expected deadline and a final deadline.
            You can complete the learning objectives by either deadline. After the expected deadline, you will receive
            feedback on each of the 3 learning objectives as well as your completion status (The objectives are all
            graded on a pass/fail basis). If you did not complete all 3 learning objectives, you have until the final
            deadline to correct your mistakes and resubmit. If you do not complete all 3 learning objectives by the
            final deadline for the assignment, you have failed the course.

        <h4>Application Objectives</h4>

        <p>
            You can earn application objectives to improve your grade in this course.
            You will have the following opportunities to complete application objectives.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Homework Application Objectives x10
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each of the 5 homework assignments contain 2 application objectives each. Each objective you
                    complete before the expected deadline of an homework will earn you 1 Application Objective
                </li>
                <li>
                    You cannot earn any credit for the Application Objectives on the final deadline.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Group Project x9
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each of the 3 parts of the project will contain 3 application objectives each. Grading for these
                    objectives will be similar to that of the homework application objectives to determine the team's
                    score for each objective. Individual grade adjustments may be made (positive or negative) if it is
                    discovered that the distribution of work is uneven across team members.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Group Project - Presentation/Demo x2
            <ul>
                <li>
                    At the end of the semester, your team will present your project to the class with an opportunity
                    to earn 2 more application objectives. You will demo the live/deployed version of your app while
                    the audience uses your app and interacts with your software
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Lecture Questions x3
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Most lectures will include questions to be answered during live lectures. These
                    will be simple
                    questions designed to encourage you to attend lecture and stay up to date on the material. Since
                    lectures will be recorded, there is a temptation to watch lecture days, or even weeks, after they
                    occur. These questions are to serve as an incentive for you to attend lecture and avoid falling
                    behind in the course.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We will drop a total of 9 (3 full weeks worth) lecture questions that were either not submitted or
                    submitted with an incorrect answer. You can use these 9 drops for any reason (Including illness or
                    travel) and no additional drops will be given for any reason (ie. If you have to miss more than 3
                    full weeks of lecture, you have bigger problems to worry about than your lecture question points).
                </li>
                <li>
                    If, after the 9 drops, you answer all lecture questions correctly, you will earn 3 application
                    objectives
                </li>
                <li>
                    If, after the 9 drops, you missed (either not submitted or submitted with an incorrect answer)
                    between 1 and 5 lecture questions, you will earn 2 application
                    objectives
                </li>
                <li>
                    If, after the 9 drops, you missed (either not submitted or submitted with an incorrect answer)
                    between 6 and 10 lecture questions, you will earn 1 application
                    objective
                </li>
                <li>
                    If, after the 9 drops, you missed (either not submitted or submitted with an incorrect answer)
                    more than 10 lecture questions, you will not earn any application
                    objectives from lecture questions
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="card-title">Homework</h3>

        <p>
            All homework assignments will be completed in Python
        </p>

        <p>
            Each assignment will be a programming/development assignment with a submission of your software on Autolab,
            though there will be <b>very little automated grading in this course</b>. You will submit
            all of the code and files that comprise your software on AutoLab in a single zip file.
        </p>

        <p>The following apply to all homework assignments except where exceptions are explicitly stated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No external libraries or frameworks are allowed if the library implements functionality that we
                covered in class (Exceptions are made for TCP and IP only)</li>
            <li>Any libraries/packages/classes/functions/etc that are included in Python that complete part
                of an assignment - related to the course content - for you are not allowed. This includes the
                HTTP module</li>
            <li>If you have any question whether or not something is allowed, please ask <b>before</b> the assignment is
                due. As a general rule: If a topic is
                covered in detail during lecture, then you must write all the code that
                implements those details.</li>

        <h3 class="card-title">Project</h3>

        <p>
            You will work in a team of 4-5 students to create a web application. You have full freedom to choose your
            own team. You are allowed to form teams across different recitation and lecture sections, though you are
            responsible for resolving any logistics are complicated by this (eg. If you form a team across lecture
            sections, make sure everyone on the team is able to make one of the lecture sections for the presentation)
        </p>

        <div><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJNl8YTLKgtoPg_RLCrq3evp9H1pVEWztUzqSI98rbVVtjAw/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">Team Formation Form</a></div>

        <p>
            Unlike the homework assignments, you are
            <b>required</b> to use libraries and frameworks on your project. The intent is that homework will show you how the
            protocols of Internet work, while the project will give you practice using the tools that you will actually
            use in the real world.
        </p>

        <h5>Weekly Meetings</h5>


        <div><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfcCq6KFFu_4cEclw_Sa3vnx8bHu4wRCh_pigZz91U9qJKA2A/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">Team Meeting and Eval Form</a></div>


        <p>
            Once meetings start, all member of your team must complete a meeting form after each meeting.
            This form will ask for a summary of the meeting, what you accomplished since the last meeting, what you'll
            complete before the next meeting, and for self and peer evaluations of all team members.
            These peer evaluations will be used as evidence when making individual grade adjustment
            decisions during grading if necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you do not fill out these meeting forms after each meeting (Once per week), your project grade will be
            reduced.
        </p>

        <p>
            You may fill out the meeting form as often as you'd like, not just when you have a team meeting. Many
            students prefer to fill out the form again to rate their team after the project deadline even if
            they don't have a team meeting after the deadline.
        </p>

        <h5>Presentation</h5>
        <p>
            You will present your project at the end of the semester:

            All submitted work must be of your own creation and you must not share your submission with anyone else. If
            any submission is very similar to what has been submitted by another student,
            or can be found online, it is in violation of this courses academic integrity policy and all students will
            be penalized whether they were copying or sharing their submission with other students so they can copy. If two
            submissions are similar beyond what is likely if the students worked independently, then <b>both students

            It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
