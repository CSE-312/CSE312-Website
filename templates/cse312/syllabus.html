        <h3 class="card-title">Recitations</h3>
        <p class="card-text">
            Starting on week 3, you will have recitation sections. These recitations will provide a chance for you to
            get extra help from the TAs in smaller groups. In general, recitation
            will offer examples, demos, and review of the previous week of content. Though you should come to these
            recitations with questions so
            the TA can present specifically about the content that is proving difficult for you.
        </p>

        <p>
            The TAs may take attendance during recitation. This attendance does not directly affect your grade.
            However, if you are struggling in the course and are taking advantage of recitations, and therefore showing
            an effort to learn the material, there may be some leniency offered if you are in danger of failing.

        <p class="card-text">
            Being successful in CSE312 requires you to complete a total of 12 learning objectives, all of which are
            programming objectives. Each of the first 4 homework assignments contain 3 learning objectives each.
            You must complete all of these objectives in order to pass the class.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are 2 deadlines for each homework assignment which are an expected deadline and a final deadline.
            You can complete the learning objectives by either deadline. After the expected deadline, you will receive
            feedback on each of the 3 learning objectives as well as your completion status (The objectives are all
            graded on a pass/fail basis). If you did not complete all 3 learning objectives, you have until the final
            deadline to correct your mistakes and resubmit. If you do not complete all 3 learning objectives by the
            final deadline for the assignment, you have failed the course.

        <h4>Application Objectives</h4>

        <p>
            You can earn application objectives to improve your grade in this course.
            You will have the following opportunities to complete application objectives.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Homework Application Objectives x5
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Each of the 5 homework assignments contain an application objective. If you complete the
                        application
                        objective before the expected deadline of that homework, will earn 1 Application Objective
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You cannot earn any credit for the Application Objectives on the final deadlines.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Group Project x9
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Each of the 3 parts of the project will contain 3 application objectives each. Grading for these
                        objectives will be similar to that of the homework application objectives to determine the
                        team's
                        score for each objective. Individual grade adjustments may be made (positive or negative) if it
                        is
                        discovered that the distribution of work is uneven across team members.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Group Project - Presentation/Demo x2
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        At the end of the semester, your team will present your project to the class with an opportunity
                        to earn 2 more application objectives. You will demo the live/deployed version of your app while
                        the audience uses your app and interacts with your software
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Lecture Questions x2
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Most lectures will include questions to be answered during live lectures. These
                        will be simple
                        questions designed to encourage you to attend lecture and stay up to date on the material. Since
                        lectures will be recorded, there is a temptation to watch lecture days, or even weeks, after
                        they
                        occur. These questions are to serve as an incentive for you to attend lecture and avoid falling
                        behind in the course.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We will drop a total of 6 (2 full weeks worth) lecture questions that were either not submitted
                        or
                        submitted with an incorrect answer. You can use these 6 drops for any reason (Including illness
                        or
                        travel) and no additional drops will be given for any reason (ie. If you have to miss more than
                        a
                        full week of lecture, you have bigger problems to worry about than your lecture question
                        points).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If, after the 6 drops, you answer all lecture questions correctly, you will earn 2 application
                        objectives
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If, after the 6 drops, you missed (either not submitted or submitted with an incorrect answer)
                        between 1 and 6 lecture questions, you will earn 1 application
                        objective
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If, after the 6 drops, you missed (either not submitted or submitted with an incorrect answer)
                        more than 6 lecture questions, you will not earn any application
                        objectives from lecture questions
                    </li>
                </ul>

        <h3 class="card-title">Last Chance Policy</h3>

        <p>
            For all learning objectives on the homework assignments, you have 2 chances to complete each object via the
            expected and final deadline. Under certain circumstances, you may be given a short extension to be able to
            one last chance to complete a learning objective after grades are released for the final deadline. The
            intent of this policy is to allow any student who putting a serious effort into being successful in the
            course to have another chance to complete the course instead of failing after struggling with a single
            objective.
        </p>

        <p>
            To earn an extension, you must have shown that you are doing your best to do well in the course. If you are
            in danger of failing because you have neglected this course, you will fail after the final deadline.
            The following criteria will be used to determine if a student has been putting enough effort into the course
            to justify an extension beyond the final deadline:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Criteria 1: Expected Deadline Submission
                <ul>
                    <li>If you did not make any submission before the expected deadline, no extension will be given.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you did make an expected deadline submission, you must have made a serious attempt to
                        complete the assignment. If your expected deadline submission is considered to be "low effort",
                        to the extent that the course staff could not give you feedback on your eventual mistakes on the
                        final deadline submission, no extension will be given (eg. If you fail on the final submission
                        for a security issue that was not present in expected submission because you did not get that
                        far in the assignment, you have effectively waived your right to the feedback and correction
                        process that is built into the course and you will fail)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you start falling behind and need to use a final deadline, you should complete your revisions
                        quickly to give yourself enough time to make a quality submission for the next assignment.
                        Falling behind is not an excuse for continuing to fall behind. You must make a serious effort
                        to get caught up after falling behind.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Criteria 2: Recitation Attendance
            <ul>
                <li>If you attended less than half of the recitations at the point of the final deadline,
                    you will not be given an extension.</li>
                <li>If you have attended at least half of the recitations, but missed the recitation(s) related to
                    the homework content that caused you to fail, you might not earn an extension</li>
                <li>Attending recitation means being on time. If you are more than 10 minutes late, you may not be
                    considered as attending</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Criteria 3: Lecture Questions
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are not on pace to earn any application objectives from your lecture question
                        performance, you will not be given any extensions.</li>
                    <li>If you have not submitted (eg. missed/skipped lecture) more than 20% of the lecture question,
                        you will not be given an extension.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If none of the above bullet points apply to you (eg. You made a quality submission for the expected deadline
            and regularly attend both recitation and lecture), you will be given a short extension after the final
            deadline grades are released.</p>

        <p>
            There will be some discretion in following these criteria (Especially in determining if an expected deadline
            submission constitutes a "serious effort"). All extension decision will be made by the course
            instructor. Any situations that are not clear based on the criteria above will be made on a case-by-case
            basis and may take additional criteria into consideration.

            <li>If you have any question whether or not something is allowed, please ask <b>before</b> the assignment is

        </p>

        <p>
            If you do not fill out these meeting forms after each meeting (Once per week), your project grade will be
            reduced.
        </p>

        <p>
            You may fill out the meeting form as often as you'd like, not just when you have a team meeting. Many
            students prefer to fill out the form again to rate their team after the project deadline even if
            they don't have a team meeting after the deadline.

            In addition to the department and university policies, the following details apply to this course.
        </p>

        <p>

            All submitted work must be of your own creation and you must not share your submission with anyone else. If
            any submission is very similar to what has been submitted by another student,
            or can be found online, it is in violation of this courses academic integrity policy and all students will
            be penalized whether they were copying or sharing their submission with other students so they can copy. If
            two
            submissions are similar beyond what is likely if the students worked independently, then <b>both students
            are in violation</b> of the academic integrity policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            All violations will result in:
        </p>

        <p>
            It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
            any question whether something you are doing is a violation or not, ask for
            clarification <b>before receiving an F in the course</b>. I will not entertain excuses after you
            have been caught.
