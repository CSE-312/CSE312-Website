        <h3 class="card-title">Homework</h3>

        <p>
            There are 5 homework assignments throughout the course. Each homework assignment will consist of:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A Learning Objective (LO)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        All features in the learning objective must be completed in order to pass the class. Learning
                        objectives will be autograded, and you have unlimited attempts to complete them before the
                        deadline
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each of the 5 hws will have an LO and you must complete all 5 LOs to pass the class
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If needed, you will be given up to 1 deadline extension on 1 Learning Objective deadline. This
                        extension will be automatically applied if you miss a Learning Objective deadline. The extended
                        deadline will be set to the day of the Application Objective deadline for that Homework
                        assignment. If you do not complete a Learning Objective by the extended deadline, or if you miss
                        a second Learning Objective deadline, you will fail the course.
                    </li>

            <li>If you have any question whether or not something is allowed, please ask <b>before</b> the assignment is
                due. As a general rule: If a topic is
                covered in detail during lecture, then you must write all the code that
                implements those details.

        <p>
            There are 2 exams in the course, a midterm and final exam, whose date are listed in the course schedule and
            contain the following objectives:
        </p>

                    <li>
                        You must earn at least half of the available points on <em>either</em> exam to pass the class
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This means that if you earn at least half the points on the midterm exam, you do not have to
                        worry about the LO on the final exam. However, if you completely bomb the midterm, you still
                        have an opportunity to complete the exam LO on the final exam

                    <li>
                        Each exam will offer the chance to earn up to 4 AOs for a total of 8 AOs that can be earned from
                        the 2 exams
                    </li>
                </ul>

        <p>No electronics or outside material are allowed
            during the exams. It's just you, the exam, and a writing utensil.
        </p>
        <p>
            Exams will be completed on paper and will be manually graded. The midterm will be graded out of 40 and the

        <h4>Application Objectives</h4>

        <p>
            You can earn application objectives to improve your grade in this course.
            You will have the following opportunities to complete application objectives.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Homework Application Objectives x10
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Each of the 5 homework assignments contain 2 application objectives. For each of these
                        objectives you complete before the Application Objective deadline of that homework, will earn
                        1 Application Objective
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All application objectives are manually graded. Grades will be released within 1 week after the
                        deadline
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Exam Application Objectives x8
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The midterm and final exams each offer the opportunity to earn 4 Application Objectives based on
                        your exam scores
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <li>Recitation x2
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There are 11 recitations throughout the semester during the weeks with "Yes Recitation" listed on
                        the course schedule. During these recitations, the TAs will provide examples and demos related to
                        the previous week of lecture content. The purpose of these recitations is to bridge the gap
                        between the more conceptual lecture content and what you are expected to code on the homework
                        assignments
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The TAs will record participation during every recitation. To earn credit for a recitation
                        you must 1) Show up on time 2) Participate in the recitation (eg. If you physically attend, but
                        don't pay attention and spend the whole time staring at your phone, the TA has the right to deny
                        your credit for that day). Some recitations may require you to complete an activity for that
                        day's participation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You may attend any of the 4 recitation sections, pending room capacity (eg. If a section becomes
                        too popular to fit everyone in the room, we will prioritize students who are registered for that
                        section and may deny others from attending). We will cover the same content throughout the week
                        of recitation so some students find it more helpful to attend earlier in the week to get started
                        on the HW earlier
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you earn participation credit during 10-11 recitations, you will earn 2 Application
                        Objectives
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you earn participation credit during 8-9 recitations, you will earn 1 Application
                        Objectives
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you earn participation credit during 0-7 recitations, you will not earn any Application
                        Objectives
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you have to miss more than 2 recitations, to the point where you will not earn both
                        Application Objectives, and you expect to be given a waiver, you must
                        provide official documentation stating that you were unable to attend recitation for more than 2
                        weeks.
                        Please note that a plane ticket is not official documentation.

                        will be simple
                        questions designed to encourage you to attend lecture and stay up to date on the material. Since
                        lectures will be recorded, there is a temptation to watch lectures days, or even weeks, after
                        they
                        occur. These questions are to serve as an incentive for you to attend lecture and avoid falling
                        behind in the course.

                    <li>
                        We will drop a total of 6 (2 full weeks worth!) lecture questions that were either not submitted
                        or were
                        submitted with an incorrect answer. You can use these 6 drops for any reason (Including illness
                        or
                        travel). If you have to miss more
                        than 2
                        full weeks of lecture, and expect to be able to makeup more than 6 lecture questions, you must
                        provide official documentation stating that you were unable to attend lecture for more than 2
                        weeks.
                        Please note that a plane ticket is not official documentation.

                    <li>
                        If, after the 6 drops, you answer all lecture questions correctly, you will earn 2 application
                        objectives
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If, after the 6 drops, you missed (either not submitted or submitted with an incorrect answer)
                        between 1 and 3 lecture questions, you will earn 1 application
                        objective
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If, after the 6 drops, you missed (either not submitted or submitted with an incorrect answer)
                        more than 3 lecture questions (>9 total question missed), you will not earn any application
                        objectives from lecture questions
                    </li>

            In addition to the department and university policies, the following details apply to this course.
        </p>

        <p>

            All submitted work must be of your own creation, and you must not share your submission with anyone else. If
            any submission is very similar to what has been submitted by another student,
            or can be found online, it is in violation of this courses academic integrity policy and all students will
            be penalized whether they were copying or sharing their submission with other students so they can copy. If
            two
            submissions are similar beyond what is likely if the students worked independently, then <b>both students
            are in violation</b> of the academic integrity policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            All violations will result in:
        </p>

        <div class="text-center alert alert-danger">
            <h3 style="color:red">An F in CSE312.</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
            any question whether something you are doing is a violation or not, ask for
            clarification <b>before receiving an F in the course</b>. I will not entertain excuses after you
            have been caught.

        </p>
        <p>
            Examples of acceptable behavior:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Discussing an assignment with your classmates and brainstorming <b>abstract</b> solutions, then writing
                your code independently
            </li>
            <li>Searching the Internet for supplementary material on the course topics</li>
            <li>Asking the teaching staff for clarification on a homework question</li>
{#            <li>Collaborating with your team mates on the team project</li>#}
            <li>Asking the course staff about a potential grading error</li>
{#            <li>Using Artificial Intelligence to help you write code <em>for the team project</em></li>#}
        </ul>

        <p>
            Examples of <b>un</b>acceptable behavior:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Submitting code or other work that is not your own for course credit.</li>
            <li>Allowing another student to see your code or submission for a homework assignment. (Ex. Sitting
                side-by-side
                while working on a homework such that you can see each other screens, hosting your code in a public
                 repository, posting your code publicly on Piazza, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>Using Artificial Intelligence to help you write code.</li>
            <li>Collaborating with another person to write code for a homework assignment.
            </li>
            <li>Copying a large amount of material found on the Internet into your homework submission.</li>
            <li>Asking any of the course staff to falsify your grade (Ex. Asking for any result that you did not
                rightfully earn). This includes pressuring your TA to give you credit for recitation when you did not
                rightfully earn it (Ex. if you showed up late).
            </li>
            <li>Attempting to access the grading code on Autolab.</li>
            <li>Submitting lecture questions without attending the entire lecture in person.</li>
            <li>Interfering with another student in a way that may affect their grade.
{#                (Ex. Launching a DoS attack on a team's app during their presentation).#}
            </li>
            <li>Using any unauthorized assistance during an exam.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Any student may be challenged by the course staff to prove that they did write any code they submitted for
            course credit. The method of proof can vary and is left for the course staff to decide. If the student fails
            to convince the course staff that they were the author of all the code they submitted for course
            credit, they will be found in violation of this academic integrity policy. Please note that if a student is
            in violation of any other part of this policy, it is still a violation even if you can prove that you were
            the author of your code (Ex. If you did write your code, but helped someone else cheat).
