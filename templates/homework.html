        <h3 class="card-title">Overview</h3>

        <p>
            There are 10 homework assignments in this course. Your lowest 2 scores will be dropped and the remaining 8
            will all be equally weighted while computing your final grade.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each assignment will be a programming/development assignment with a submission of your software and
            documentation on AutoLab, though there will be <b>no automated grading in this course</b>.
        </p>

        <p>The following apply to all homework assignments except where exceptions are explicitly stated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may choose any programming language you prefer</li>
            <li>No external libraries or frameworks are allowed (TCP and concurrency exception below for certain languages)</li>
            <li>Any libraries/packages/classes/functions/etc included with your language of choice that completes part
                of an assignment - related to the course content - for you are not allowed. This includes any and all
                HTTP libraries</li>
            <li>Code included with your language of choice that handles TCP socket servers and concurrency are allowed.
                Most assignments will start with a TCP socket server upon which you'll develop a web server. Industry
                standard external library for TCP and concurrency are allowed if they are common in the community
                for your language (Ex. Akka for Scala).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="card-title">Documentation</h3>

        <p>
            Each homework must be accompanied by report. This report will serve as documentation for the course staff
            to understand your code during grading. At a minimum your reports must include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                How to run your software
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        After downloading the zip file with your code, list all steps needed to run your software.
                        Include
                        any important details such as specific compiler versions, build tools required, services that
                        need
                        to be running, etc. You can assume your audience is technically minded
                    </li>
                    <li>Ex. It's fine to say "run gcc on server.c" or "run server.py with python3" without further
                        explanation, but your instructions
                        cannot be ambiguous. Saying "Compile server.c" or "run server.py" is not acceptable since you
                        might have tested
                        with a different compiler/interpreter than the course staff will run
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                How to test your software
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This must include step-by-step instructions containing everything the course staff needs
                        to
                        confirm that you've completed the objectives of the assignment
                    </li>
                    <li>Ex. Include the paths to your endpoints, testing procedures, expected behaviour
                    </li>
                    <li>The simplest way to write this section is to write out the steps you took to verify that your
                        software completed the objectives
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The architecture of your software
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Describe how you completed the objectives of the assignment, how your software is structured, and
                    why you made the design decisions you made. A reader should have a good understanding of your
                    software by reading this section without looking at a single line of your code
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These reports will guide the course staff while grading your assignments.
            Note that it is possible for you to complete the programming part of
            an objective and not earn full credit due to poor documentation and organization. Specific grading decisions
            will be made the course staff on a case-by-case basis.

        <h3 class="card-title">Submission</h3>

        <p>
            Each homework assignment is submitted in three parts:
        </p>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Software
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        All of the code and files that comprise your software submitted on AutoLab in a single zip file
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                documentation
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A single txt document meeting the requirements listed above
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Self-Evaluation Form
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Fill out a form reporting how much of the assignment you successfully completed
                </li>
                <li>
                    To ensure timely grading without automated grading: If the course staff does not grade your homework
                    submission within 1 week of the deadline, you will earn the grade you self-reported via this form.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Intentionally falsifying this form is an academic integrity violation.
